# BUDGET-TRACKER

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user of this application is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions such as deposits and expenses offline, the total will be updated when they're brought back online. This aplication uses a service worker, a web manifest, and IndexedDB for offline functionality. This application is deployed on Heroku using MongoDB Atlas.
